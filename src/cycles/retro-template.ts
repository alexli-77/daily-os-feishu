 * The retro scaffold, copied from the shape the Feishu retro column has always
 * had: three emoji-led sections in a fixed order.
 *
 * This is not decoration. life-review-os parses a retro back out by looking for
 * exactly these headings — see `bin/life-review-os.mjs`, which splits on
 * `(?:😄\s*)?状态`, `(?:👍🏻?\s*)?做[得的]好` and `(?:💪🏻?\s*)?待改进` and feeds
 * the three pieces to the planner as the previous cycle's context. A retro
 * written in the UI without them still reads fine to a human but arrives at the
 * next planning run as one undifferentiated blob.
 *
 * The parser tolerates a missing emoji and either of 做得好 / 做的好; this
 * template picks the spelling the existing vault files use.

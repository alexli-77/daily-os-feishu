/**
 * LEO-278 — a finished life-review-os run lands in `20_CYCLES` instead of only
 * in Feishu.
 *
 * Before this, the one production writer of a cycle file was the UI's save
 * endpoint: a human typing into a textarea. The whole history in `20_CYCLES`
 * came from the one-shot LEO-280 migration, so running a new biweekly produced
 * nothing the Cycles page could show.
 *
 * The two writes go to two *different* cycles, and that asymmetry is the only
 * thing here worth being careful about:
 *
 *   要务    -> `writeback.target_week`, the cycle being planned
 *   review  -> `evidence.review_week`, the cycle that just ended
 *
 * That is the same rule the migration encodes, and the same one PR #28 fixed in
 * the Feishu path after a review was written next to the wrong column. Rather
 * than restate it, this module reuses `migration.ts` outright — `parseRun`,
 * `renderPrioritiesFromRun`, `startDateForLabel` and `applyCyclePlan` — so the
 * markdown a new run produces is byte-identical to the migrated history and
 * there is exactly one implementation of "what does a cycle file say".
 *
 * `applyCyclePlan` also carries the re-run rules for free: a section the user
 * has edited (`source: user`) is never clobbered, and an unchanged section is
 * not rewritten, so re-planning the same cycle is a no-op rather than a
 * timestamp bump.

 * The migration avoided this by reading the Feishu table's first column, which
 * holds the objective names — but a fresh run has no table read to borrow from.
 *
 * The quarterly OKR file is the same list in the same order (`Objective O1..O7`

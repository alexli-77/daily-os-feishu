 * 685k characters — a prompt of 868k, comfortably past any model's context —
 * and every scheduled `daily_plan` died on the agent's own 180s timeout. The
 * run ledger recorded it, `safeTick` logged it to stderr, and the user simply
 * never received a morning plan. Nothing in the pipeline had an opinion about
 * how big a prompt was allowed to be.
 *
 * So this is a backstop, not a tuning knob. The connectors should return
 * something reasonable; this makes sure that when one of them stops being
 * reasonable — a doc grows, a repo gets chatty — the run degrades into a
 * smaller plan instead of producing nothing at all. Everything it removes is
 * reported in `notes`, because a budget that trims in silence just moves the
 * invisible failure one layer down.

/**
 * Shipped assets must be findable from a working directory that is not the
 * checkout.
 *
 * Independent, tsx-runnable:  npx tsx scripts/tests/install-root.test.ts
 *
 * Since the service started shipping inside the Mac app, the code is read-only
 * in `Daily OS.app/Contents/Resources/service` and the working directory is
 * `~/Library/Application Support/DailyOS`. Every `path.resolve('prompts/…')`
 * and `path.resolve('.env.example')` written before that split silently means
 * "somewhere in the user's data directory", where no template has ever lived.
 *
 * The failure mode is what makes this worth a test rather than a code review:
 * it is invisible from the checkout, because there the two directories are the
 * same one. It is also invisible on an *installed* machine as long as some
 * earlier call already created the file — which is exactly how the second copy
 * of this logic survived the first fix and crashed `daily-os ui` on a fresh
 * directory months later.
